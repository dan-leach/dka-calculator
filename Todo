Done:

- retrospective start --> no audit ID --> retrospective episode workflow --> step 2
- retrospective start --> has audit ID --> step 2 (provide audit ID, DOB and NHS) --> API returns

To do:

- handle step 2 API response:
  if no audit ID --> Swal error with retrospective episode option
  if no patient hash --> Swal error with step 3 confirmation (protocol start date/time, region, centre)
  if has audit ID and patientHash:
  if has auditData --> Swal error to warn resubmitting with overwrite, can still proceed to step 4
  if no auditData --> proceed to step 4
