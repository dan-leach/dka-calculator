// For future refs it might be possible to simplify the pass function from:
        pass: function(){
                        if (this.condition_1() && this.condition_2()) return true;
                        return false;
                    },
// to:
        pass: function(){
                        return this.condition_1() && this.condition_2();
                    },

// but it works perfectly fine at the moment, so no need to change!

line 706:
// added text to make explicit that weight limit is recommended by BSPED guideline

index.js

// Consider adding failure to the Age varable if the DOB is updated to be out of range i.e. if a user initially adds an acceptable DOB then changes it,
// currently the Age variable remains updated with previous number - may be unnecesary though
line 107 add: 					indexForm.inputs.age.set(-1);
line 104 move to 109:					//indexForm.inputs.age.blur();

// Do you want to add a time check for protocols generated far in the past by accident? Not in index.js as I can see, can even be before they were born
// Such as:
line 184:   				if (this.goodFormat() && this.notFuture() && this.recentPast()) return true;
insert at line 195:
			recentPast: function(){
				if (moment().diff(moment(this.value(), "DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm"), 'months') <= 12) return true;
				return false;
			},
insert at line 198
				if (!this.recentPast()) return "Protocol start date/time must be within the last year.";

// I wonder if you want to keep the error message up for weight even when override is ticked, though could make it less prominent
// Should there be a hard limit that cannot be overriden, like 150kg max?

// If permitting input of previous dates for Protocol start time, your calculation of age in months and all contingent could be wrong
// e.g. line 338 which seems to calculate age in months c.f. current time, not age at protocol start
// Perhaps an argument to make protocol start within last month?

// Line 391 & 396 - should this refer to the upper and lower limits within calcVars.js not be hard coded?

// Line 703 - On testing I am not getting this box to confirm I wish to proceed with the 200kg Joe Bloggs
// Still with disabled popup blocker. I can run the function from the console and the popup comes.

// Updates we did together to make the override box pop up:
Line 681:       		    	
if (indexForm.inputs.weight.isOverridden()) {
    this.confirmOverride();
} else {
    this.send();
}
Line 721:
indexForm.submit.send();
Line 741 add:
this.preSendSet();
this.store();
